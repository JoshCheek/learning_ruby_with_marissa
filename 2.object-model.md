Simplified Object Model
=======================

* The Object Model
  * Objects (store data)
    * instance variables (hash of symbols (like strings) which are the variable names)
    * pointer/reference to a class
  * Classes (store methods)
    * instance methods (hash, keys are method names)
    * pointer to a superclass
    * constants (hash, keys are constant names)
  * Stack (FILO) of Bindings (execution context)
    * local variables (hash, keys are variable names)
    * self (the "current" object)


The more in-depth version
=========================

* object model:
  * Objects (store data in ivars)
    * hash of instance variables (keys are the variable names)
    * pointer to the class
  * Classes (store code in methods)
    * hash of methods (keys are the method names)
    * pointer to superclass
    * hash of constants (keys are constant names)
    * object stuff
  * Bindings (execution context)
    * pointer to self (the implicit current object)
    * hash of local variables (keys are var names)
    * optional pointer to a enclosing binding (eg how a block can see locals of its env)
  * Stackframe (executes code)
    * binding (the execution context)
    * lexical scope (where to look for constants, AKA `cref`)
    * instructions (the code itself)
    * instruction pointer (where we're at in the code)
  * Callstack (allows jumping between stack frames, eg for method calls)
    * a stack of stackframes
